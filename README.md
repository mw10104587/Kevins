Intro:
A web-based platform that helps those who speak English as a second language to find their best fit bank agents.

Goal: 
There are over 40% of unbanked people in New York City, after doing survey on the Internet and in the fields, the main reasons are: 
1. Language Barrier
2. Lack of trust
3. poverty

We want to build a "Yelp" of Banking for immigrants and non-native speakers. By providing reviews of other users, the quality of agents can be measured. People will have more trust on the agents they are going to meet. Also, most banks already have agents that speaks different language such as Spanish, Chinese and Russian. By sending users to the right branch, they can meet the right agent who can explain all the legal documents thouroughly. We hope to reduce the amount of unbanked or underbanked people in New York City.

features:
- location based
- include most of the banks in New York City
- match users' native language

tools:
- bootstrap
- react.js

Story:
When I first arrive in the New York City, I didn't know where I should open up my bank account. My English wasn't fluent enough, and I am not sure about their difference. After my colleagues introduced me an agent -- Kevin -- who services at a Chase bank branch around 84 Street, I decided to open up my account there. Despite I have several Chase banks near my home in 34 Street, I still wanted to go, because I believe people who speaks Mandarin could explain way much better, also it was recommended by my friend. 

I feel lucky to be infored by my friend. Unfortunately, not every one have the resource or connections to get this information. Instead of telling people which bank to go to in the future, we hope that people can tell their friends who have banking needs, "use the Application Kevin!"
